## About the Project
This program solves the x vector in [the matrix equation Ax=b](https://math.berkeley.edu/~arash/54/notes/01_04.pdf) using sympy, numpy, and scipy.linalg. Assume B is a matrix and [x]B is a vector. The process of matrix multiplication can be explained by [clicking here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html).

## Compile Instructions
